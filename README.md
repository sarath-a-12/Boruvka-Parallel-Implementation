# Boruvka's Algorithm in a multicore CPU

Boruvka's algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. I have implemented a parallel version of the same in
the C programming language and have used Open MP as a tool to unlock parallelism. Implementation details can be found below.
